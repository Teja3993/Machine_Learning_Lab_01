Handling Non-normal Feature Distribution
To understand how feature distributions impact machine learning preprocessing.
I explored mathematical background, transformation methods, and practical application on real datasets.

Iris Dataset was used and features are Sepal length and petal length.

In this experiment I determined whether the features sepal length and petal length followed Normal/Gaussian distribution, if Gaussian distribution wasn't followed by a feature that feature was discarded.
